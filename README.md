Welcome to the repository for the T.R.E.S.\
This is an app designed to provide guidance for risk of tornadoes based on sounding and/or model data. 
> [!WARNING]
> This software is meant solely for guidance. No risk is a guarantee.


**Planned improvements**\
-Better graphic design (I prefer doing backend work so this is long term)\
-Actual release (such as exe file)\
-properly weighted values for calculation\
-lapse rate calculations\
-finishing shear and thermo panels\
-ability to input skew-t text files\
-maybe automatic polling of data for a point?
